AFL Video plugin for XBMC
================================

*UPDATE*: Now updated for 2014 season, including NAB Challenge matches

This plugin provides a simple list of available programs from the AFL web site
and allows you to stream them with.

Match replay content is only available with Australia, so you will need some
sort of proxy or VPN to view them. All other videos seem to be available 
internationally.

AFL Video plugin for Kodi
=========================

*UPDATE*: Now updated for 2017 season and we now support the free AFL Live Pass
subscription from Telstra.

This plugin provides a simple list of available programs from the AFL web site
and allows you to stream them with.

Match replay content is only available with Australia, so you will need some
sort of proxy or VPN to view them. All other videos seem to be available 
internationally.
